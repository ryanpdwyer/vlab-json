This solution contains a dilute mixture of the         protein and HCl. What is Ka of the protein? (Please show your work.)</p>      <p><b>2.</b> <font color=\"gray\">(3pts)</font> Based on you answer to part        1, at what pH will the ratio [Protein-]/[HProtein] = 0.75? (Please show        your work.)</p>      <p><b>3.</b> <font color=\"gray\">(5pts)</font> Create 100ml of solution        such that when you add between 1 and 5ml of the protein solution of part        1, the ratio [Protein-]/[HProtein] = 0.75. Please test that your        solution works. Also please describe what you did, and report the        solutions and amounts you mixed together to make your 100ml        solution.</p>     "
