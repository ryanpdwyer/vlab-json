	"assignmentText": "      In this problem, you will accurately determine the concentration of a      solution of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) using a 0.500M potassium hydrogen      phthalate (KHP) standard solution.  Acid-base indicator phenophthalein is      added in its (colorless) acidic form to a precise volume sample of KHP.      The base NaOH is slowly added to the sample of KHP. Once all the KHP has      reacted with the base, the first excess drop of NaOH will cause the      indicator to convert to its basic (pink) form. The exact concentration of      the NaOH solution can then be calculated.    </p>  <p><b>Experimental Procedure:</b><br> Retrieve the KHP, 1M NaOH solution,        and the phenolphthalein from the stockroom.  Note the volume of KHP, which can        be found in the <i>Solution Info</i> window.</p>      <p>Retrieve a disposable pipette and a 50 mL buret. </p>      <p>Use a disposable pipette to add a small amount (~0.3 mL) of indicator        to the KHP solution.  </p>      <p>Fill the buret with NaOH solution. </p>      <p>Titrate small volumes (~ 0.5 mL or less) of NaOH from the buret into        the KHP until a slight color change occurs. Note the volume of NaOH        used, which can be found in the <i>Solution Info</i> window.</p>     "
