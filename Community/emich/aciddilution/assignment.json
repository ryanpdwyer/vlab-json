{   "assignmentText": "The pH scale is a powerful and widely used way of describing the acidity or alkalinity of substances. It is fairly common knowledge that neutral water has a pH of 7, acids have a pH &lt;7 and bases have a pH &gt;7, but few people understand this in terms of the actual hydronium ion [H<font size='-1'><sub>3</sub></font>O<font size=-1><sup>+</sup></font>] concentration. </p><p>Our objective is to develop an understanding of logarithmic scales by developing a pH scale by carrying out successive dilutions of solutions of HCl and NaOH. We will then explore how acid-base indicators can be used to identify the pH of a solution.</p><p><i>Note:  The Solution Viewer has been turned off for this experiment</i></p><p>Chem116 students should follow the recommended procedure and complete the report worksheet: <b>Chem116pHScaleIndicators.doc</b>.</p>"}
