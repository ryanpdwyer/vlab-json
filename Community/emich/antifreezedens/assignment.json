    "assignmentText": "<p>You have just purchased 3 bottles of antifreeze for your car at a bargain price. However, inasmuch as the three bottles are unlabeled, it is not clear which of them should be used for your car. (You live in Ypsilanti whose winter temperature seldom gets below -10<sup><font size='-1'>o</font></sup>F) After you decide which  bottle to use, you plan to sell the other two bottles to your friends -  one of whom lives in upper Minnesota, and the other in Georgia. </p><p>To solve your problem, you first are going to have to determine the density of the unknown antifreeze solutions and some samples of known concentrations of ethylene glycol-water mixtures. You can then graphically determine the percent composition of the contents of each of the unlabeled antifreeze bottles.  Finally you can use this information to graphically determine the freezing point of each of the Antifreeze solutions. (You will also learn about interpolations and extrapolations in your graphical analysis using an introductory graphing program, Create-a-Graph (http://nces.ed.gov/nceskids/createagraph/default.aspx). </p><p> Some data you might find of use:</p> <ul><p><b>20% Ethylene Glycol</b>, freezing point = -7.9<sup><font size='-1'>o</font></sup>C,  17.8<sup><font size='-1'>o</font></sup>F<br> <b>30% Ethylene Glycol</b>, freezing point = -14<sup><font size='-1'>o</font></sup>C, 6.8<sup><font size='-1'>o</font></sup>F<br> <b>50% Ethylene Glycol</b>, freezing point = - 33.8<sup><font size='-1'>o</font></sup>C, -28.8<sup><font size='-1'>o</font></sup>F</p></ul> <p>Chem116 students should follow the recommended procedure provided in the report worksheet: <b>Chem116Antifreeze.doc</b>.</p><p> <i>Note:</i> The &quot;Precise Transfer&quot; mode has been disabled in this exercise so you must use &quot;Realistic Transfer&quot; techniques."
