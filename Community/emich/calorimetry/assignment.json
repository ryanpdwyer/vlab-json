{   "assignmentText": "In an earlier experiment (Salt solubility and Temperature) you may have observed the heat given off for an exothermic physical processes) or absorbed (for an endothermic physical process) when a salt was dissolved in water. Many chemical reactions also exhibit exothermic or endothermic behavior. The neutralization of hydrochloric acid by a base such as sodium hydroxide is an exothermic chemical process. Calorimetry is the experimental method used to determine the actual amount of heat produced or absorbed in these processes. In this exercise you will determine the heat of solution for two of the salts you studied in earlier, as well as the heat of reaction for the neutralization of hydrochloric acid by sodium hydroxide. </p> <p><br> Chem116 students should follow the recommended procedure: <i>Chem116Calorimetry.doc</i>, and complete the report worksheet: <i>Chem116CalorimetryReport.doc</i></p>."}
