    "assignmentText": "<p> In this exercise you will investigate the reaction of washing soda (sodium carbonate, Na<sub>2<\/sub>CO<sub>3<\/sub>) with hydrochloric acid (aqueous HCl) to form &quot;table salt&quot; (sodium chloride, NaCl) and water and carbon dioxide. You will use quantitative measurements to find out how many moles of NaCl are formed from 1 mole of Na<sub>2<\/sub>CO<sub>3<\/sub>. You will use this information to write a balanced equation for this synthesis reaction. <\/p><p><i>(Note: In this exercise the PreciseTransfer mode has been disabled so you must use the &quot;<b>Realistic Transfer</b>&quot; technique.
