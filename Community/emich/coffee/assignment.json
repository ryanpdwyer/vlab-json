	"assignmentText": "<p>During the summer after your first year at Eastern Michigan University, you are lucky enough to get a job making coffee at Starbucks, but you tell your parents and friends that you have secured a lucrative position as a &quot;java engineer.&quot; </p><p> Every day, an eccentric chemistry professor (not mentioning any names) stops in and orders 250 ml of Sumatran coffee at precisely 95<sup>o</sup>C.  He then adds enough milk at 10<sup>o</sup>C to drop the temperature of the coffee to 90<sup>o</sup>C.</p><p><b>1)</b> Calculate the amount of milk (in mL) that the professor must add to reach this temperature.  Show all your work, and data. <br> <b>2)</b> Use the Virtual Lab to make the coffee/milk solution and verify the answer you calculated.<br> <b>3)</b> Optional: Expand your investigation to a real-life example.</p> <p>Assume coffee and milk have the same specific heat capacity: 4.186 J/g <sup>o</sup>C. and that they also have the same density: 1.0 g/mL. In this activity, we are also assuming that no heat is lost to the environment, to replicate this you&apos;ll need to &quot;insulate&quot; the glassware. </p> <p>In the Virtual Lab, you can set the temperature of liquids and insulate glassware by right-clicking on a beaker or flask (Mac users: hold down the command key while clicking on the glassware). Select &quot;Thermal Properties&quot from the pop-up menu that appears. That will open a dialogue box. Check the box labeled &quot;insulated from surroundings.&quot; The temperature of the solution in that beaker or flask will remain constant. You can also use the &quot;Thermal Properties&quot; box to set the temperature of a solution. </p>"
