    "assignmentText": "<p>In the first part of the experiment dealing with the conservation of matter you prepared solutions of sodium chloride, magnesium chloride, and sodium sulfate decahydrate. In the Solution Viewer window you were able to record the mass of the ions present in the solution, but not their concentrations. Preparing solutions of known concentration is an important part of most laboratory work. In this exercise you will prepare some solutions of these salts of a given concentration. You will then indicate the ions present in the solution and their concentrations.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; -Prepare 100 mL of a 1.00 M NaCl.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; -Prepare 100 mL of a 0.1 M MgCl<sub>2</sub> soution.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; -Prepare 250 mL of a 0.5 M solution of Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>.<br></p><p>Chem116 students should follow the recommended procedure and complete the report worksheet: <i>Chem116SolnPrep.doc.</i><br></p><p>In this exercise the &quot;Precise Transfer&quot; mode has been turned off so you must use &quot;Realistic Transfer&quot; techniques. (The Solution Viewer has also turned off.)</p> "
