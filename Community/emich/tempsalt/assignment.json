{   "assignmentText": "You may have noticed that you can dissolve more sugar or table salt (NaCl) in hot water than in cold water. This is because the solubility of these substances often increases with increases in temperature. But is it always true that solubility increases with temperature? In this virtual laboratory you will check out the effect of temperature changes on 6 salts, and then look at the trends graphically.</p><br><p>Chem116 students should follow the recommended procedure in <b>Chem116SaltSolb-Temp.doc</b> and complete the data report worksheet, <b>Chem116Salt-Temp Data Sheets.doc</b>. The graphical analysis uses a separate worksheet, <b>CHEM116Salt-Temp Graph.doc</b>."}
