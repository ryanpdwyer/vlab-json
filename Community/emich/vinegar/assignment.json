    "assignmentText": "<p>In this activity you will learn about titrations used to determine the concentrations (Molarity and percent) of vinegar solutions. In the first part you will check your titration technique on an acetic acid solution of known concentration. In the second part you will determine the concentration of a vinegar solution.</p><p><i>In this experiment the precise transfer tool has been turned off so you will have to use the <b>realistic transfer</b> mode. The <b>Solution Viewer</b> has also been turned off.</i></p><P>Chem116 students should follow the recommended procedure and complete the report worksheet: <i>Chem116VinegarAnalysis.doc</i>."
