He then adds enough milk at 4C to drop the          temperature of the coffee to 90C.</p>  <ul><b>a)</b> Calculate the amount of milk (in ml) the professor must add to         reach this temperature.  Show all your work, and circle the answer.  <p><b>b)</b> Use the Virtual Lab to make the coffee/milk solution and verify  the answer you calculated in a).  </p> </ul> <p>Note:, in order to accurately measure temperature changes in the virtual lab, it is helpful to be able to set the temperature of a solution and insulate it from its surroundings. To do this in the Virtual Lab, use the &quot;Thermal Properties&quot; dialog. Windows users should right click on the beaker or flask; Mac-users should command-click on the beaker or flask. From the menu that appears, choose &quot;Thermal Properties&quot; You may now manually enter a temperature for a solution. If you check the box labeled &quot;insulated from surroundings&quot;, the solution in that beaker or flask will then not exchange heat with the surroundings. Please press the OK button before closing the dialog box to ensure that the vessel is insulated.<p> (Assume coffee and milk have the same specific heat capacity: 4.186 J/g C.  Assume that they also have the same density: 1.0 g/ml.)*   </p>    "
