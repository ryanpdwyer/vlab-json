	"assignmentText" : "<p>Aqueous solutions of sucrose are important in many different food products. In this activity, you will prepare solutions with specific concentrations of sucrose. You will also design experiments to measure the concentration of sucrose. <\/p><ul><li><p>The Coca-Cola Company long ago decided not to patent its formula, but instead protected the recipe as a &quot;trade secret&quot; so no one else could copy it. While writing a book about the company entitled &quot;For God, Country, and Coca-Cola,&quot; Mark Pendergrast believed he came across the formula (called Formula X) and published it. It contains 30 lbs of sugar in 2.5 gallons of water.<br \/><\/p><p>Prepare this solution in the Virtual Lab and calculate its sucrose concentration in mass percent, molarity, molality and mole fraction.<\/p> <\/li><li><p>The virtual lab stockroom contains a sample of a &quot;Generic Brand Cola&quot;. Design and perform experiments to determine the sucrose concentration. Give you answer in mass percent, molarity, molality and mole fraction. [Hint: Compare the density of your &quot;Formula X&quot; solution with that of pure water.]<\/p><\/li><li><p>Does the generic brand have more or less sugar than 'Formula X'? <\/p><\/li>"
