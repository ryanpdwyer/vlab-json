	"assignmentText": "You are a workstudy for the chemistry department.  Your supervisor has just asked you to prepare 500mL of 3M HCl for tomorrow&#39;s undergraduate experiment.  In the stockroom explorer, you will find a cabinet called &quot;Stock Solutions&quot;.  Open this cabinet to find a 2.5L bottle labeled &quot;11.6M HCl&quot;.  The concentration of the HCl is 11.6M. Please prepare a flask containing 500 ml of a 3 M (+/- 0.005M) solution and relabel it with its precise molarity.  Note that you must use <i>realistic transfer</i> mode, a buret, and a volumetric flask for this problem.<p>Please do any relevant calculations on the paper supplied. As a reminder, to calculate the volume needed to make a solution of a given molarity, you may use the following formula:</p><p align=\"center\"> C<sub><font size=\"-2\">1</font></sub>V<sub><font size=\"-2\">1</font></sub> = C<sub><font size=\"-2\">2</font></sub>V<sub><font size=\"-2\">2</font></sub> </p> </font>"
