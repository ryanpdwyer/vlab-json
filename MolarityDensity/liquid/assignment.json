	"assignmentText": "You work for a company that has many different research groups, and your group has just developed a new food preservative which has been named &quot;Compund A&quot; <p> Another group in your company has developed a new neurotoxin, which they have unfortunately also called &quot;Compound A&quot; <p> An intern was reorganizing the chemical storage stockroom, and placed all the bottles labeled &quot;Compound A&quot; on the same shelf. <p> You would like to begin testing the new food preservative, but don√≠t know which bottle contains the food preservative and which contains the neurotoxin. It would clearly not be a good idea to put neurotoxin into your food products. You have asked a theoretical chemist what to do, and he said that the preservative will have a higher density. <p> Design an experiment to determine which bottle of &quot;Compound A&quot; contains the food preservative. <p> <i>(Note, the solution viewers and precise transfer mode have been disabled for this activity, you may find a volumetric flask and scale useful in performing this experiment.)</i>"
