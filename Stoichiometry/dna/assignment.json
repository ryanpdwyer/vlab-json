	"assignmentText": "<p>In this activity, you will work with a reaction between strands of DNA. Remember that DNA is a sequence of the letters A,C,T, and G and that A binds with T and C binds with G. Solutions are specified by the DNA sequence, such as ACAC or TG, and by the concentration in units of microM = 10<sup><font size=-1>-6</font></sup>M. </p> <p> Consider mixing 10 ml of 0.20 microM ACAC with 10ml of 0.30 microM TG. <p> First, predict what should be present in the solution resulting from the above mixture. <p> Create the above mixture and see if the results agree with your prediction. If not, determine your error and fix it. </p>"
