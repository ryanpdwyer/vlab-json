Use the solution viewer to determine the number of grams of Na<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>-</sup> in the solution, and confirm that these add to 1.00g. <li>The solution labeled &quot;1.00g AgNO<sub>3</sub>&quot; contains 1.00g of solid AgNO<sub>3</sub>. Add 100ml of water to this solution. Use the solution viewer to determine the number of grams of Ag<sup>+</sup> and NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> in the solution.<p> <li>Now add the 1.00g of solid AgNO<sub>3</sub> to the 1.00g solution of NaCl. Write down the mass of each species in solution and the mass of solid AgCl formed. Confirm that the amounts of these species are consistent with what you say in parts (2) and (3). </ol> <p><b>2.)</b> The solution labeled &quot;Solution 1&quot; in the virtual lab stockroom contains 2.00 grams of Sodium Chloride. <ol type=\"a\"> <li>How many grams of Silver Nitrate must be added to the solution to completely react with Sodium Chloride according to the reaction above.<p> <li>Use the virtual lab to add that amount of Silver Nitrate to the solution. Check to make sure the reaction was complete, by making sure the amount of Ag<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>-</sup> in the solution are both less than 0.01g. </ol> <p><b>3.)</b> The solution labeled &quot;Solution 2&quot; in the virtual lab stockroom contains 3.00 grams of AgNO<sub>3</sub>. <ol type=\"a\"> <li>If excess NaCl is added to the solution, how many grams of AgCl<sub>(s)</sub> will be formed? <li>Use the virtual lab to check your answer to part (a). Explain the laboratory procedure you used to perform this check. </ol>"
