However, this time the density of the solution is unknown.  </p>  <ul><b>a)</b> Determine the specific heat capacity of the Compound A Solution using the Virtual Lab  <p><i>Note: You may find a scale and graduated cylinder useful in your experiment. </i></p> </ul> <p>(Assume the heat capacity of water is 4.184 J/g C) </p> <p> For this activity, we are assuming that no heat is lost to the environment,    so youll need to &quot;insulate&quot; the glassware. In the Virtual Lab, right-click on    a beaker or flask (Mac users: hold down the command key while clicking on the    glassware). Select &quot;Thermal Properties&quot; from the pop-up menu that appears. That    will open a dialogue box. Check the box labeled &quot;insulated from surroundings.&quot;    The temperature of the solution in that beaker or flask will remain constant.    You can also use the &quot;Thermal Properties&quot; box to set the temperature of a solution.  </p>    "
