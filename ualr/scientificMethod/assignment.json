Further investigation finds some old 50-gallon drums, which have obviously been leaking.<\/p><p align=center><img src=\"http:\/\/collective.chem.cmu.edu\/chem\/ualr\/vlab_html5\/scripts\/resources\/assignments\/ualr\/scientificMethod\/oildrum.jpg\" width=\"220\" height=\"220\"><br><font size=-1>Old Oil Drums</font><\/p><p>After contacting authorities you discover there used to be a near by storage facility for the metal ions of sodium, magnesium, calcium and mercury. You take samples from four of the 50-gallon drums (which you label A-D) and suspect one or more of them contains a Mercury compound (with the Mercurous ion Mg<sub><font size=-2>2<\/font><\/sub><sup><font size=-2>+2<\/font><\/sup>). <\/p> <p>The stockroom in the virtual stock room has the 4 samples that you collected from each of the drums.  Your objective is to familiarize yourself with the virtual lab and to identify which drum(s) (A through D) contain Mercury.<\/p>  <p>Hint:  To help you with your testing, the stockroom also has samples that contain the mercurous, sodium, magnesium, calcium and chloride ions.  Chloride is a negative ion while the former are positive ions.  You know positive and negative charged ions attract and sometimes the attraction is so great that a solid precipitate forms. <\/p><p>Using the virtual lab, determine which metal ions can form a solid and using this information determine which barrel(s) contain the mercury.
